      <h1>Hello.</h1>
      <h3>My name is Eiji_Myzn</h3>
      <p>
        I am an sftware depeloper.
        Most of my work is open source and publicly available on GitHub.
        
        I have an old blog which I no longer actively update - you probably want to follow me on Twitter and Medium for more up-to-date content.

        If you happen to speak Chinese, my Chinese name is 尤雨溪. you can also find me on 微博 and 知乎.

        Outside of programming and helping my wife take care of our two kids, I enjoy video games, karaoke, sushi and collecting watches.
